=== Enums

Also called Enums, enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular set of allowed
values. You can define a enum type with `DSL.enum`:

[source, groovy]
----
import gql.DSL
import graphql.schema.GraphQLEnumType

include::{testMain}/gql/dsl/EnumTypeSpec.groovy[tags=declaringEnum, indent=0]
----

Then you can use that type as any other type for your type's fields

[source, groovy]
----
import gql.DSL
import graphql.schema.GraphQLObjectType

include::{testMain}/gql/dsl/EnumTypeSpec.groovy[tags=enumTypeInclusion, indent=0]
----
