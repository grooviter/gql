=== Inputs

Apart from using scalar values, like enums or string when passing arguments to a given query
you can also easily pass complex objects. This is particularly valuable in the case of mutations, where
you might want to pass in a whole object to be created. In GraphQL that means using input types.

Lets say we have a query to filter our mail inbox by `from` and `to`:

[source, groovy]
.query
----
include::{testMain}/gql/dsl/InputTypeSpec.groovy[tags=inputTypeQuery, indent=0]
----

We can model the `MailFilter` input type as:

[source, groovy]
.declaration
----
include::{testMain}/gql/dsl/InputTypeSpec.groovy[tags=inputTypeDeclaration, indent=0]
----

And finally when executing the query we can pass a map with the mail filter values.

[source, groovy]
.execution
----
include::{testMain}/gql/dsl/InputTypeSpec.groovy[tags=inputTypeQueryExecution, indent=0]
----
