== Gradle

You can add the following dependency to your Gradle project

[source, gradle]
----
compile com.github.grooviter:gql:0.1.0'
----

The library is available at Bintray so all you have to do is
to include the `jcenter()` declaration in your dependency repositories
in your Gradle script.

[source, groovy]
----
repositories {
   jcenter()
}
----
