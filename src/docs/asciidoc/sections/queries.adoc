== Queries

**GQL** allows you to execute both string queries or queries built via DSL
builder. The former is useful if you already have the queries and you
are sure they work as expected. The latter is a safer way of building
queries because it gives you some sanity checks based on the types
used.

=== Execute queries

If you're using the underlying **GQL** GraphQL engine to execute your queries, it would be nice
to be able to declare and execute queries in one shot right ?

[source, groovy]
----
include::{testMain}/gql/DSLSpec.groovy[tags=staticQuery, indent=0]
----

=== Query string

Sometimes your exposed GraphQL schema may be backed up by another third party GraphQL engine implementation, but
instead of writing or queries by hand we still may want to use the DSL to build the query and then use the resulting
string against the other engine.

[source, groovy]
----
include::{testMain}/gql/DSLSpec.groovy[tags=queryString, indent=0]
