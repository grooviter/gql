== Queries

GQL allows you to execute both string queries or queries built via DSL
builder. The former is useful if you already have the queries and you
are sure they work as expected. The latter is a safer way of building
queries because it gives you some sanity checks based on the types
used.

include::{testMain}/gql/DSLSpec.groovy[tags=staticQuery]

=== Query string
