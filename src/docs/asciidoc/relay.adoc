=== What GQL implements ?

According to the https://facebook.github.io/relay/[Relay] official site, the three core
assumptions that Relay makes about a GraphQL server are that it provides:

- A **mechanism for refetching** an object.
- A description of **how to page** through connections.
- Structure around **mutations** to make them **predictable**.

Relay uses GraphQL as its query language, but it is not tied to a specific implementation of GraphQL. In order to
achieve these three goals, the Relay specification defines three conceps: **Node**, **Connection**, **Edges**.

You can think of the relationship between the three terms looking at this diagram:

 +----------+             +------------+             +---------+
 |          |    (0, N)   |            |    (0, N)   |         |
 |   Node   +------------>| Connection +------------>|  Edges  |
 |          |             |            |             |         |
 +----------+             +------------+             +---------+

....

A **Node** may have a **Connection** and a **Connection** may have 0 to N **Edges**. Lets see what these
terms mean.
