=== Node

A **Node** is a type that can be retrieved by an unique identifier. A node may have two types of
fields: **simple fields**, and **connections**:

- **id**: A node can be identified by an unique id
- **field**: A node's simple attribute
- **connection**: A node's one-to-many relationship

They way a node handles fields of type one-to-many is through another type called **Connection**.
This is how you can declare a node:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{testMain}/gql/relay/RelaySpec.groovy[tags=node, indent=0]
----

<1> Node description
<2> A normal field
<3> A one-to-many field
<4> A fetcher that builds a Connection instance out of the list returned by this closure
