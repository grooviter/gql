=== Connection

A **Connection** is just a convention on how to access one-to-many relationships in a node, and how to
paginate through those items. A **Connection** has two fields:

- **pageInfo**: information regarding on how to paginate through the edges
- **edges**: a collection of result items

Every edge has two fields:

- **cursor**: identifies where in the pagination cursor is the edge located
- **node**: the edge payload
